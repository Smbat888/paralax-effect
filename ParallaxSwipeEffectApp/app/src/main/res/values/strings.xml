        London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.
        Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London\'s ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in England.

        Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core.
        The bulk of this conurbation forms the Greater London administrative area (coterminous with the London region), governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

        London is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transport all contributing to its prominence.
        It is one of the world\'s leading financial centres and has the fifth-or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on measurement.
        London is a world cultural capital.
        It is the world\'s most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world\'s largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic.
        London\'s 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.

    <string name="bangkok">
        Bangkok is the capital and the most populous city of Thailand.
        The city occupies 1,568.7 square kilometres (605.7 sq mi) in the Chao Phraya River delta in Central Thailand, and has a population of over 8 million, or 12.6 percent of the country\'s population.
        Over 14 million people (22.2 percent) live within the surrounding Bangkok Metropolitan Region, making Bangkok an extreme primate city, dwarfing Thailand\'s other urban centres in terms of importance.

        Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 15th century, which eventually grew in size and became the site of two capital cities: Thonburi in 1768 and Rattanakosin in 1782.
        Bangkok was at the heart of Siam\'s (as Thailand used to be known) modernization during the later 19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was the centre stage of Thailand\'s political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule and underwent numerous coups and uprisings.
        The city grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact among Thailand\'s politics, economy, education, media and modern society.

    <string name="singapore">
        Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a modern city-state and island country in Southeast Asia.
        It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator.
        The country\'s territory consists of the diamond-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets.
        Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia\'s Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south.
        The country is highly urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains.
        The country\'s territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.

        The islands were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a series of local empires.
        Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with permission from the Johor Sultanate.
        The British obtained sovereignty over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826.
        Occupied by the Japanese during World War II, Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963 and united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of parliament.
        Singapore has since developed rapidly, earning recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.

    <string name="istanbul">
        Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey, constituting the country\'s economic, cultural, and historical heart.
        Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, with its commercial and historical centre lying on the European side and about a third of its population living on the Asian side of Eurasia.
        With a population of 14.4 million, the city forms the largest urban agglomeration in Europe as well as the largest in the Middle East, and the sixth-largest city proper in the world.
        Istanbul\'s vast area of 5,343 square kilometers (2,063 sq mi) is coterminous with Istanbul Province, of which the city is the administrative capital.
        Istanbul straddles the Bosphorus strait in northwestern Turkey, between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.

        Founded on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BC as Byzantium, the city now known as Istanbul developed to become one of the most significant cities in history.
        For nearly sixteen centuries following its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 AD, it served as an imperial capital for the Roman and Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires.
        It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.

        from where skilled labour fled after the communist government took over China in 1949 and subsequently purged its population during the 1960s.

        After China\'s defeat in the First Opium War (1839–42) against the British Empire, Hong Kong became a British colony with the perpetual cession of Hong Kong Island, followed by Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.
        After it was occupied by Japan during the Second World War (1941–45), the British resumed control until 30 June 1997.
        As a result of the negotiations between China and Britain,
        Hong Kong was transferred to the People\'s Republic of China under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.
        The city became China\'s first Special Administrative Region on 1 July 1997 under the principle of "one country, two systems".

        The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river.
        Vatican City is an independent country within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.

        Rome\'s history spans more than two and a half thousand years.
        Although Roman tradition states the founding of Rome around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited much earlier, being one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.
        The city\'s early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans and Sabines.
        Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded as one of the birthplaces of Western civilization.
        It is referred to as "Roma Aeterna" (The Eternal City) and "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World), two central notions in ancient Roman culture.

    <string name="milan">
        Milan is the second-most populous city in Italy and the capital of Lombardy.
        The city proper has a population of about 1.3 million, while its urban area is the 5th largest in the EU with an estimated population of about 5,264,000.
        The massive suburban sprawl that followed the post-war boom of the 1950s–60s and the growth of a vast commuter belt, suggest that socio-economic linkages have expanded well beyond the boundaries of its administrative limits and its agglomeration, creating a polycentric metropolitan area of between 7 and 10 million people, stretching over the former provinces of Milan, Bergamo, Como, Lecco, Lodi, Monza and Brianza, Pavia, Varese, Novara.
        The Milan metropolitan region is part of the so-called Blue Banana, the area of Europe with the highest population and industrial density, and one of the Four Motors for Europe.

         Milan was founded by the Insubres, a Celtic people.
        The city was later conquered by the Romans as Mediolanum, eventually becoming the capital of the Western Roman Empire.
        During the Middle Ages, Milan flourished as a commercial and banking center.
        In the course of the following centuries, it had been alternatively dominated by France, Habsburg Spain, and Austria, until 1859 when the city joined the rising Kingdom of Italy.
        During the early 1900s, Milan led the industrialization process of the young nation, being at the very center of the economic, social, and political debate.
        Badly affected by World War II, and suffering a harsh Nazi occupation, the city became the main centre of the Italian Resistance.
        In post-war years, the city enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, attracting large flows of workers from Southern Italy.
        During the last decades, Milan has seen a dramatic rise in the number of international immigrants, and in 2011 more than one sixth of its population is foreign born.
